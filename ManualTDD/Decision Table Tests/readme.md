Decision table test generation: A decision table is a
tabular representation that maps different combinations of
input conditions to their corresponding actions or outcomes.
Each row of the table represents a rule, specifying a particular
combination of inputs (conditions) and the expected output
(action). For problems involving multiple decision points or
conditions, using Decision Table Testing can ensure that the
LLM is exposed to a wide range of scenarios. Decision Table
Testing ensures that every combination of input conditions
is covered, providing the LLM with a comprehensive set of
scenarios to generate code for. This method is especially useful
for problems with multiple decision paths, such as dynamic
programming or branching algorithms.
