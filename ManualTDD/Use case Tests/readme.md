Use Case Testing is a black-
box testing technique that focuses on the real-world usage of
the software. It tests how a system behaves according to a
predefined set of use cases, which are scenarios that describe
a sequence of interactions between a user and the system.
These scenarios are based on functional requirements, and
they aim to ensure that the system behaves as expected when
used under normal or specific conditions.Instead of testing
individual components or edge cases in isolation, use case
testing provides a holistic view of the problem and solution.
