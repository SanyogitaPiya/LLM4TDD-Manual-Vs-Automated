Boundary Value Analysis
(BVA) is a black-box testing technique used to identify errors
at the boundaries of input domains, where errors are more
likely to occur. Boundary value analysis focuses on edge cases
and this method is effective because systems often exhibit
errors at these boundary points where behavior might change.
These boundaries often expose issues related to off-by-one
errors, array overflows, or incorrect handling of upper and
lower limits.
